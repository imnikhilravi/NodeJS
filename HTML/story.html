            <h2>The time I felt iPhone's are over rated</h2>
            <p> I came from a place where iPhone is considered more of a brand value to the person rather than a good gadget. 
                What comes along with it is the pride of having an iphone in a country where an under previliged family can 
                live a whole year with the cost of one iphone. </p>
            <p> Last year when I purchased a new iPhone 7 within the first week of its release, peers at work were discussing about 
                me for nearly a month. That's the value iPhone brings to a person in a country like India.</p>
            <p> But when I came here to USA I can see iphone's everywhere and with everyone. I guess iPhone is the only phone people
                here know. This is where I got to know what a waste its spending a ton on iphone and getting it in a country especially 
                like ours. As a phone there are many great phones compared to Apple, so its always good to get a great deal of phones 
                if we forget the brand value it gets and focus on the specs. </p>
